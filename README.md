# Week One Level One Challenge: Variation on the Dice Game of Pig

## A variation of the dice game Pig

Create a program that will randomly select two numbers from 1-6 (like rolling two dice). Show the dice rolls. You should also show the running score.


Prompt the user to either roll again or lose their turn.

A player scores the sum of the two dice thrown and gradually reaches a higher score as they continue to roll. If a single number 1 is thrown on either die, the score for that whole turn is lost. However a double 1 counts as 25.
When you reach a score of 100 (or more) the game ends.

See the example output below.
